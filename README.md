## 🎓 Key Concepts

### Global Audio Context

Music continues playing even when navigating between pages thanks to a persistent audio context and ref-based audio element.

### Dynamic Styling

Album artwork colors are extracted using Canvas API and applied as gradient backgrounds for a immersive visual experience.

### Smart Storage

- **localStorage** - Favorites persist across sessions
- **sessionStorage** - Recently played clears on browser close

### Keyboard Control

- **Space** - Play/Pause
- **→** - Next track
- **←** - Previous track
- **↑/↓** - Volume up/down

---

## 📱 Responsive Breakpoints

- **Mobile** (<768px) - Hamburger menu, compact player
- **Tablet** (768-1024px) - Sidebar visible, optimized layout
- **Desktop** (>1024px) - Full sidebar, expanded player

---

## 🔐 Security

- Supabase RLS (Row Level Security) policies on tables
- Public storage buckets for media access
- Environment variables for sensitive config
- No credentials stored in code

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Audio not playing?

- Check if Supabase storage buckets are **Public**
- Verify audio file URLs in browser console
- Ensure browser allows audio autoplay

### Authentication issues?

- Confirm email confirmation email received
- Check Supabase email templates are enabled
- Verify Google OAuth credentials

### Build errors?

```bash
npm install         # Fresh install
npm run build       # Build for production
npm run lint        # Check for linting errors
```
